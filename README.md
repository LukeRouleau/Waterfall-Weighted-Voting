# Waterfall-Weighted-Voting
Book Club Voting + Python = Waterfall-weigthed voting. This is a locally stored implementation for an admin that interacts with a CSV file.

STILL IN DEVELOPMENT: Since the book club fell apart, this is low on the totem poll since it is a trivial application.

EXTENTIONS: 
 - Take this command line applicationa and make it into a discord bot for book/film clubs.
